[![XDP Firewall Build Workflow](https://github.com/gamemann/XDP-Firewall/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/gamemann/XDP-Firewall/actions/workflows/build.yml) [![XDP Firewall Run Workflow](https://github.com/gamemann/XDP-Firewall/actions/workflows/run.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/gamemann/XDP-Firewall/actions/workflows/run.yml)

A *stateless* firewall that attaches to the Linux kernel's [XDP](https://www.iovisor.org/technology/xdp) hook through [(e)BPF](https://ebpf.io/) for fast packet processing. This firewall is designed to read filtering rules from a config file and filter incoming packets. Both IPv4 and **IPv6** are supported! The protocols currently supported are TCP, UDP, and ICMP. The firewall also has the option to display counters for allowed, dropped, and passed packets which are written to `stdout`.

I hope this project helps existing network engineers and programmers interested in utilizing XDP or anybody interested in getting into those fields! (D)DoS protection and mitigation is an important part of Cyber Security and understanding the concept of networking and packet flow on a low-medium level would certainly help those who are pursuing a career in the field 🙂

## Building & Installing
Before building, ensure the following packages are installed. These packages can be installed with `apt` on Debian-based systems (e.g. Ubuntu, etc.), but there should be similar package names in other package managers.

```bash
# Install dependencies.
sudo apt install -y libconfig-dev llvm clang libelf-dev build-essential

# Install dependencies for building LibXDP and LibBPF.
sudo apt install -y libpcap-dev m4 gcc-multilib

# You need tools for your kernel since we require BPFTool. If this doesn't work, I'd suggest building BPFTool from source (https://github.com/libbpf/bpftool).
sudo apt install -y linux-tools-$(uname -r)
```

You can use `git` to clone this project. Make sure to include the `--recursive` flag so it downloads the XDP Tools submodule!

```bash
# Clone repository via Git. Use recursive flag to download XDP Tools submodule.
git clone --recursive https://github.com/gamemann/XDP-Firewall.git

# Change directory to repository.
cd XDP-Firewall
```

From here, you have two options to build and install this tool which are explained below.

### With Bash Script
The easiest way to build and install this tool is to use the provided [`install.sh`](./install.sh) Bash script. This script relies on `sudo` being installed on your system. If you do not have sudo, please refer to the below steps on building and installing this tool without the Bash script.

If you don't have LibXDP installed on your system yet, I'd recommend using the following command.

```bash
./install.sh --libxdp
```

Otherwise, you can exclude the `--libxdp` flag if you'd like.

Additionally, here is a list of flags you may pass to this script.

| Name | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| --libxdp | Build and install LibXDP before building the tool. |
| --no-install | Build the tool and/or LibXDP without installing them. |
| --clean | Remove build files for the tool and LibXDP. |
| --no-static | Do *not* statically link LibXDP and LibBPF object files when building the tool. This makes the build process faster, but you may need to alter your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` env variable before running the tool and requires LibXDP to be installed on your system already. |
| --objdump | Dumps the XDP/BPF object file using [`llvm-objdump`](https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-objdump.html) to Assemby into `objdump.asm`. |
| --help | Displays help message. |

![Script Build Demo](./images/build_script.gif)

### Without Bash Script
If you do not want to use the Bash script above, you may use `make` to build and install this tool instead.

```
# Build XDP-Tools (LibXDP and LibBPF).
make libxdp

# Install LibXDP & LibBPF onto your system.
# Warning: This command must be executed as root! `sudo` should do this for you if you have it installed and have privileges.
sudo libxdp_install

# Build the firewall tool.
make

# Install the tool onto your system.
# Warning: This command must be executed as root! `sudo` should do this for you if you have it installed and have privileges.
sudo make install
```

#### Notes
* All settings within a filter rule other than `enabled` and `action` are **not** required. This means you do not have to define them within your config.
* When a filter rule's setting is set (not `NULL`), but doesn't match the packet, the program moves onto the next filter rule. Therefore, all of the filter rule's settings that are set must match the packet in order to perform the action specified. Think of it as something like `if src_ip == "10.50.0.3" and udp_dport == 27015: action`. 
* As of right now, you can specify up to 60 total filter rules. You may increase this limit by raising the `MAX_FILTERS` constant in the `src/common/config.h` [file](https://github.com/gamemann/XDP-Firewall/blob/master/src/common/config.h#L5) and then recompile the firewall. If you receive a BPF program too large error, this is due to BPF's limitations with complexity and jumps. You may try increasing BPF limitations manually or with a patch. If you want to do this, please read [this](https://github.com/gamemann/XDP-Forwarding/tree/master/patches) README from my XDP Forwarding project.

### Example
Here's a config example.

```squidconf
verbose = 5;
log_file = "";
interface = "ens18";
update_time = 15;
no_stats = false;
stats_per_second = true;

filters = (
    {
        enabled = true,
        action = 0,

        udp_enabled = true,
        udp_dport = 27015
    },
    {
        enabled = true,
        action = 1,

        tcp_enabled = true,
        tcp_syn = true,
        tcp_dport = 27015
    },
    {
        enabled = true,
        action = 0,

        icmp_enabled = true,
        icmp_code = 0
    },
    {
        enabled = true,
        action = 0,
        src_ip = "10.50.0.4"
    }
);
```

## Notes
### XDP Attach Modes
By default, the firewall attaches to the Linux kernel's XDP hook using **DRV** mode (AKA native; occurs before [SKB creation](http://vger.kernel.org/~davem/skb.html)). If the host's network configuration or network interface card (NIC) doesn't support DRV mode, the program will attempt to attach to the XDP hook using **SKB** mode (AKA generic; occurs after SKB creation which is where IPTables and NFTables are processed via the `netfilter` kernel module). You may use overrides through the command-line to force SKB or offload modes.

Reasons for a host's network configuration not supporting XDP's DRV mode may be the following.

* Running an outdated kernel that doesn't support your NIC's driver.
* Your NIC's driver not yet being supported. [Here's](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/docs/kernel-versions.md#xdp) a NIC driver XDP support list. With enough Linux kernel development knowledge, you could try implementing XDP DRV support into your non-supported NIC's driver (I'd highly recommend giving [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayFWnFj5fY8) video a watch!).
* You don't have enough RX/TX queues (e.g. not enabling multi-queue) or your RX/TX queue counts aren't matching. From the information I gathered, it's recommended to have one RX and TX queue per CPU core/thread. You could try learning how to use [ethtool](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ethtool.8.html) and try altering the NIC's RX/TX queue settings ([this](https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/multiqueue-nic/) article may be helpful!).

#### Offload Information
Offloading your XDP/BPF program to your system's NIC allows for the fastest packet processing you can achieve due to the NIC dropping the packets with its hardware. However, for one, there are **not** many NIC manufacturers that do support this feature **and** you're limited to the NIC's memory/processing (e.g. your BPF map sizes will be extremely limited). Additionally, there are usually stricter BPF verifier limitations for offloaded BPF programs, but you may try reaching out to the NIC's manufacturer to see if they will give you a special version of their NIC driver raising these limitations (this is what I did with one manufacturer I used).

As of this time, I am not aware of any NIC manufacturers that will be able to offload this firewall completely to the NIC due to its BPF complexity. To be honest, in the current networking age, I believe it's best to leave offloaded programs to BPF map lookups and minimum packet inspection. For example, a BPF blacklist map lookup for malicious source IPs or ports. However, XDP is still very new and I would imagine we're going to see these limitations loosened or lifted in the next upcoming years. This is why I added support for offload mode on this firewall. 

### Moved To LibXDP
On **June 6th, 2023**, we've started using [LibXDP](https://github.com/xdp-project/xdp-tools/tree/master/lib/libxdp) from [XDP Tools](https://github.com/xdp-project/xdp-tools) to load and attach the XDP/(e)BPF program. This requires additional packages and tools to install and use with this XDP firewall as noted above.

### Issues On Ubuntu 20.04
If you have issues on Ubuntu 20.04 or earlier, please refer to the reply on [this](https://github.com/gamemann/XDP-Firewall/issues/41#issuecomment-1758701008) issue.

Basically, Clang/LLVM 12 or above is required and I'd recommend running Linux kernel 5.3 or above.

### BPF For/While Loop Support + Performance Notes
This project requires loop support with BPF. Older kernels will not support this feature and output an error such as the following.

```vim
libbpf: load bpf program failed: Invalid argument
libbpf: -- BEGIN DUMP LOG ---
libbpf:
back-edge from insn 113 to 100

libbpf: -- END LOG --
libbpf: failed to load program 'xdp_prog'
libbpf: failed to load object '/etc/xdpfw/xdpfw_kern.o'
```

It looks like BPF loop [support](https://lwn.net/Articles/794934/) was added in kernel 5.3. Therefore, you'll need kernel 5.3 or above for this program to run properly.

#### Performance With `For` Loops
Due to the usage of a [`for` loop](https://github.com/gamemann/XDP-Firewall/blob/master/src/xdp/prog.c#L249) inside the XDP program that handles looping through all filtering rules inside of a BPF array map, performance will be impacted depending on how many filtering rules you have configured (ultimately, the firewall **doesn't scale** that well). This firewall was designed to be as flexible as possible regarding configuration and is most effective when configured to add malicious source IPs to the block map for a certain amount of time which are then dropped at the beginning of the XDP program for the best performance.

Unfortunately, we can't really eliminate the `for` loop with the current amount of flexibility we allow (especially minimum/maximum TTL, packet lengths, IDs, etc.), unless if we were to create more BPF maps and insert many more entries which would result in a lot more memory consumed and isn't ideal at all. If we were to remove flexibility, the best approach would be to store filtering rules inside a hashed BPF map using the packet's destination IP/port as the entry's key in my opinion (this would then eliminate flexibility related to being able to specify a filtering rule to match against a single destination IP without a port, unless if we implemented multiple BPF map lookups inside the XDP program which would then impact performance). However, there are currently no plans to switch to this format due to the amount of flexibility lost and also not having the time on my side (if somebody else creates a PR to implement this, I'd be willing to have a separate branch with the new functionality for others to use if the current branch isn't working out for their needs).

The firewall is still decent at filtering non-spoofed attacks, especially when a block time is specified so that malicious IPs are filtered at the beginning of the program for some time.

### Error Related To Toolchain Hardening
As stated in issue [#38](https://github.com/gamemann/XDP-Firewall/issues/38) by [g00g1](https://github.com/g00g1), if you have toolchain hardening enabled, you may receive the following error when compiling.

```
error: <unknown>:0:0: in function xdp_prog_main i32 (ptr): A call to built-in function '__stack_chk_fail' is not supported.
```

In order to fix this, you'll need to pass the `-fno-stack-protector` flag to Clang when building LibBPF and the firewall itself. You'll want to modify the `Makefile` for each project to add this flag. Patches for this may be found [here](https://github.com/gamemann/XDP-Firewall/issues/38#issuecomment-1547965524)!

### Will You Make This Firewall Stateful?
There is a possibility I may make this firewall stateful in the future *when* I have time, but this will require a complete overhaul along with implementing application-specific filters. With that said, I am still on contract from my previous employers for certain filters of game servers. If others are willing to contribute to the project and implement these features, feel free to make pull requests!

You may also be interested in this awesome project called [FastNetMon](https://github.com/pavel-odintsov/fastnetmon)!

### Rate Limits
By default, client stats including packets and bytes per second are calculated per *partial* flow (source IP/port and protocol). This is useful if you want to specify connection-specific rate limits inside of your filtering rules using the `pps` and `bps` settings. However, if you want to calculate client stats using only the source IP, you may comment out [this](https://github.com/gamemann/XDP-Firewall/blob/master/src/common/config.h#L12) line.

```C
//#define USE_FLOW_RL
```

### Error While Loading Shared Libraries
If you receive an error similar to the one below when running the program and have built the program using the no static option, make sure you have LibXDP globally installed onto your system via [XDP Tools](https://github.com/xdp-project/xdp-tools). You can execute `make libxdp && sudo make libxdp_install` to build and install both LibXDP and LibBPF onto your system separately.

```bash
./xdpfw: error while loading shared libraries: libxdp.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```

If you still run into issues, try adding `/usr/local/lib` to your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` since that's where LibXDP installs the shared objects from my testing. Here's an example.

```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib

sudo xdpfw
```

### Filter Logging
This tool uses `bpf_ringbuf_reserve()` and `bpf_ringbuf_submit()` for filter match logging. At this time, there is no rate limit for the amount of log messages that may be sent. Therefore, if you're encountering a spoofed attack that is matching a filter rule with logging enabled, it will cause additional processing and disk load.

I recommend only enabling filter logging at this time for debugging. If you'd like to disable filter logging entirely (which will improve performance slightly), you may comment out the `ENABLE_FILTER_LOGGING` line [here](https://github.com/gamemann/XDP-Firewall/blob/master/src/common/config.h#L27).

```C
//#define ENABLE_FILTER_LOGGING
```

I will most likely implement functionality to rate limit log messages from XDP in the future.

### LibBPF Logging
When loading the BPF/XDP program through LibXDP/LibBPF, logging is disabled unless if the `verbose` log setting is set to `5` or higher.

If the tool fails to load or attach the XDP program, it is recommended you set `verbose` to 5 or above so LibXDP outputs specific warnings and errors.

## My Other XDP Projects
I just wanted to share other open source projects I've made which also utilize XDP (or AF_XDP sockets) for those interested. I hope code from these other projects help programmers trying to utilize XDP in their own projects!

### [XDP Forwarding](https://github.com/gamemann/XDP-Forwarding)
This project performs basic layer 3/4 forwarding using source port mapping similar to IPTables/NFTables and utilizes XDP.

### [Kilimanjaro](https://github.com/gamemann/Kilimanjaro)
This is a complex packet processing/forwarding/dropping project I made for a gaming community I was a part of that utilizes XDP, AF_XDP, and the IPIP network protocol. I no longer work on/maintain the project, but the source code may be very helpful to other XDP developers, especially when it comes to manipulating packets inside of XDP and such.

### [Packet Batch (AF_XDP)](https://github.com/Packet-Batch/PB-AF-XDP)
An application that utilizes fast [AF_XDP](https://docs.kernel.org/networking/af_xdp.html) Linux sockets to generate and send network packets. This is used for penetration testing including [Denial of Service](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/denial-of-service/) (DoS), network monitoring, and more!

While this application doesn't utilize native XDP or (e)BPF, I do feel it should be mentioned here. AF_XDP sockets are very fast and often used with raw XDP programs via the `bpf_redirect_map()` function call (also see my [XDP Stats](https://github.com/gamemann/XDP-Stats) project which calculates stats in raw XDP and AF_XDP programs).
